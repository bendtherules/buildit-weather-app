`npm i`

Running the app
---------------
`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

To host the build folder, host it with a server with `/*` redirected to `index.html` (for routing to work correctly).
